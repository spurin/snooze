Ever wanted an HTTP server that does *almost nothing*, but does it with style? **snooze** is here to serve you-literally. Based on the same ultra-minimal philosophy as [idle](https://github.com/spurin/idle), **snooze** listens on a single port, sends a static response, and then goes right back to its nap.

## Features

- **Ultra-Lightweight**: Built on a `scratch` base, compiled statically, and stripped for maximum minimalism.
- **Default Port**: `80`, so you don’t have to think too hard.
- **Default Message**: `"Hello from snooze!"`, because sometimes that’s all you need.
- **Full Request Logging (default)**: Each request is logged as **one contiguous block** (request line, headers, and body if `Content-Length` is present). No flags or env vars required.
- **Flexible Overriding**:
  - **Environment Variables**: `PORT`, `MESSAGE`
    (Highest priority: if these are set, they override everything else.)
  - **Command-Line Flags**: `--port=YOUR_PORT`, `--message=YOUR_MESSAGE`
    (Used only if environment variables are **not** set for those fields. You can set either one independently without affecting the other.)
  - **Defaults**: If neither environment variables nor command-line flags are provided, snooze uses `80` and `"Hello from snooze!"`.
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Handles `SIGINT` and `SIGTERM`, letting you put it to bed without fuss.
- **Prebuilt Images**: You can pull directly with Docker, Kubernetes, or any OCI-compatible tool:
```plaintext
docker pull spurin/snooze:latest
```

## Logging

Snooze **logs the full incoming HTTP request by default** as a single block:

```
=== snooze request dump from 172.64.66.1:56754 ===
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:8080
User-Agent: curl/8.7.1
Accept: */*

=== end request dump ===
```

If the client sends a body with a `Content-Length`, snooze will read and log **exactly that many bytes** (no truncation). If no `Content-Length` is present, snooze logs the headers (and any bytes that arrived with them) and immediately responds.

> **Heads‑up:** Raw logging captures everything the client sent (including Authorization/Cookie headers and bodies). Handle logs with care.

---

## Build (Optional)

If you want to build **snooze** yourself you need the following dependencies:

- gcc or clang
- make
- cmake

To build **snooze**:

```bash
cd build/
cmake ..
make
```

then you will find the _snooze_ binary in the `build/` directory.

## Quick Start (Docker)

**Easiest**: run with default port (80) and message:

```bash
docker run --rm -p 80:80 spurin/snooze:latest
```

Check in your browser at `http://localhost` or:

```bash
curl http://localhost
# Output: "Hello from snooze!"
```

View the **container logs** to see the request dump:

```bash
docker logs <container-id>
```

### Override Using Environment Variables

```bash
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 \
  -e PORT=8080 \
  -e MESSAGE="Custom Snooze Message" \
  spurin/snooze:latest
```

Check:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080
# Output: "Custom Snooze Message"
```

### Override Using Command-Line Flags

Because environment variables take priority, only use flags if you don’t specify `PORT` or `MESSAGE` via env. You can override **both** or **one**:

```bash
# Override both port and message
docker run --rm -p 9090:9090 \
  spurin/snooze:latest \
  --port=9090 \
  --message="Command line override!"
```

Check:

```bash
curl http://localhost:9090
# Output: "Command line override!"
```

Or just one of them:

```bash
# Only override port (keep default message)
docker run --rm -p 7070:7070 \
  spurin/snooze:latest \
  --port=7070
```

```bash
curl http://localhost:7070
# Output: "Hello from snooze!"
```

---

## Kubernetes Examples

### 1. Minimal Deployment (No Overrides)

A simple Deployment referencing the public image. By default, **snooze** listens on port 80 and sends `"Hello from snooze!"`.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: snooze
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: snooze
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: snooze
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: snooze
        image: spurin/snooze:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

### 2. Command-Line Flags Override

If you want to override via command-line flags within Kubernetes YAML, you can specify `args` to pass them directly to the existing ENTRYPOINT. For example:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: snooze-override-cmd
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: snooze-override-cmd
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: snooze-override-cmd
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: snooze
        image: spurin/snooze:latest
        # Let the container keep its ENTRYPOINT of "/snooze"
        # but override with these flags:
        args:
          - "--port=8080"
          - "--message=Hello from command-line in K8s!"
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
```

This tells **snooze** to listen on port **8080** and respond with `"Hello from command-line in K8s!"`.

### 3. Using a ConfigMap for HTML Content

If you prefer to keep your message in a ConfigMap (for example, to serve HTML with `<head>` and `<body>` tags), you can do this:

**Create a ConfigMap and Deployment**:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: snooze-config
data:
  message: |
    <html>
    <head><title>Snooze</title></head>
    <body>
      <h1>Hello from snooze ConfigMap!</h1>
      <p>We can store any HTML here.</p>
    </body>
    </html>
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: snooze-config-deploy
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: snooze-config
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: snooze-config
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: snooze
        image: spurin/snooze:latest
        env:
          # This sets the MESSAGE environment variable
          # from the key "message" in the ConfigMap
          - name: MESSAGE
            valueFrom:
              configMapKeyRef:
                name: snooze-config
                key: message
          # Optionally override the port with an env var
          - name: PORT
            value: "8080"
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
```

With this setup, **snooze** reads your HTML from the `MESSAGE` environment variable. When you make a request to port **8080**, you’ll receive your entire HTML from the ConfigMap.

### 4. Multi-Path Ingress Example

Below is a demonstration of path-based routing across three color-coded Deployments and Services. Each path (/red, /green, /blue) points to a different instance of snooze, each listening on a distinct port and returning a unique message.

```yaml
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: snooze-red
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: snooze-red
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: snooze-red
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: snooze
        image: spurin/snooze:latest
        args:
          - "--port=8081"
          - "--message=RED!"
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8081
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: snooze-red-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: snooze-red
  ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 8081
      protocol: TCP
  type: ClusterIP
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: snooze-green
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: snooze-green
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: snooze-green
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: snooze
        image: spurin/snooze:latest
        args:
          - "--port=8082"
          - "--message=GREEN!"
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8082
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: snooze-green-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: snooze-green
  ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 8082
      protocol: TCP
  type: ClusterIP
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: snooze-blue
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: snooze-blue
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: snooze-blue
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: snooze
        image: spurin/snooze:latest
        args:
          - "--port=8083"
          - "--message=BLUE!"
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8083
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: snooze-blue-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: snooze-blue
  ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 8083
      protocol: TCP
  type: ClusterIP
---
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: snooze-colors-ingress
spec:
  rules:
    - host: snooze.example.com
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /red
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: snooze-red-service
                port:
                  number: 80
          - path: /green
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: snooze-green-service
                port:
                  number: 80
          - path: /blue
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: snooze-blue-service
                port:
                  number: 80
```

Three Deployments (snooze-red, snooze-green, snooze-blue) each run snooze on different ports (8081, 8082, 8083) with distinct messages (RED!, GREEN!, BLUE!).

Three ClusterIP Services route traffic from port 80 to each respective containerPort.

The Ingress resource routes:

- /red to snooze-red-service
- /green to snooze-green-service
- /blue to snooze-blue-service

## Cleanup / Removal

- **Docker**: Just stop the container (`Ctrl-C` in foreground or `docker stop <id>` if running in detached mode).
- **Kubernetes**: Remove Deployments, ConfigMaps, or Services by running:
```bash
kubectl delete deployment snooze
kubectl delete deployment snooze-override-cmd
kubectl delete deployment snooze-config-deploy
kubectl delete configmap snooze-config
kubectl delete deployment snooze-red
kubectl delete deployment snooze-green
kubectl delete deployment snooze-blue
kubectl delete svc snooze-red-service snooze-green-service snooze-blue-service
kubectl delete ingress snooze-colors-ingress
```

## Why snooze?

- **Test & Debug**: Perfect for verifying Kubernetes Ingress, load balancers, or quick dev checks.
- **Simplicity**: No overhead from large frameworks-just a tiny compiled binary.
- **Minimal Attack Surface**: Less code, fewer dependencies-less to go wrong.
- **Education**: Great example of how to create a statically linked, scratch-based HTTP container.
